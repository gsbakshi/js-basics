                    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a
                        <a
                            href="#"
                            data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
                            class="info-modal"
                            >dynamic, interpreted</a
                        >
                        and
                        <a
                            href="#"
                            data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making sure you're always working with the correct values."
                            class="info-modal"
                            >weakly typed</a
                        >
                        programming language which was built with the purpose of
                        running in host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage
                        in the browser).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web
                        as it's the only "thing" in web development that allows
                        you (= the developer) to change something on the page at
                        runtime. Basically everytime something opens, closes,
                        moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript will be
                        involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely
                        powered by JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering
                        work happens in the browser) - those pages typically use
                        frameworks like Angular, but that's a topic we'll cover
                        later in the course. :-)

                    <h2>What will you learn in this Course?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This course teaches JavaScript from the ground up - no
                        prior JavaScript knowledge is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll dive into all the basics and core concepts as well
                        as advanced features and patterns all the way up to
                        expert concepts and topics.
                    </p>
